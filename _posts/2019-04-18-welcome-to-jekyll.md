 DIP-COATER INSTRUMENT CODE
 
This sketch is for running a dip-coater instrument controlled by an
arduino and drived by a servo-motor. The progress is reported on 16X2 
LCD display.

// include the library code:
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
#include <Servo.h>

// initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins
LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);
int pos = 0, dip = 0, set = 50, dly = 500;
// pos, dip are the iniciators. set = number of dips wanted, dly = delay between changing position 

Servo servo_9;

void setup() {
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 5);
  servo_9.attach(9);
  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd.print("Number of Dips");
}

void loop() {
  // going down
  if(dip <= set)
  {
     for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
    // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    servo_9.write(pos);
    // wait 'dly' ms for servo to reach the position
    delay(dly); // Wait for dly
  }
  // going up

    delay(dly);// Wait for dly
  }
  // delay after one full cycle
  delay(10000);
  // increase the dip count
  dip = dip + 1;
  
  // set the cursor to column 0, line 1
  // (note: line 1 is the second row, since counting begins with 0):
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  // print the number of seconds since reset:
  lcd.print(dip);
  lcd.print(" t(s)=");

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
